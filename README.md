Push_Swap is a classic project from 42 School that challenges you to sort data using stacks and a limited set of operations.
The goal is to write a program that takes a list of integers and sorts them in ascending order using the fewest possible moves.

This project teaches you how to:

Work with stacks and linked lists efficiently.

Implement and optimize algorithms for sorting under constraints.

Think critically about algorithmic efficiency and performance.

Manipulate data using only push, swap, rotate, and reverse operations.

By the end, youâ€™ll have a program that not only sorts numbers correctly but also demonstrates optimized logic and careful planning, skills that are directly applicable to real-world algorithmic challenges.
